# Face Recognition Application (Introduction)
In this project we have developed a face recognition application that can be integrated in multiple usecases like
attendance system, id verification and many more. There is a code (Image Dataset Creation) that uses the feed of webcam to capture 100 images
that are used to train our model that we have created by using transfer learning technique(VGG16).
After training the model we have a file (app) that comprises the code to take the live feed from webcam 
and make predictions.
